  <!-- Attributes for FocusArea. -->
  <declare-styleable name="FocusArea">
    <!-- The ID of the default focus view. The view will be prioritized when searching for a
         focus target.
         (1) When the user nudges the rotary controller, it will search for a target FocusArea,
             then search for a target view within the target FocusArea, and focus on the target
             view. The target view is chosen in the following order:
               1. the "android:focusedByDefault" view, if any
               2. the "app:defaultFocus" view, if any
               3. the selected item in a scrollable container, if any
               4. the first focusable item in a scrollable container, if any
               5. previously focused view, if any and the cache is not stale
               6. the first focusable view, if any
             Note that 5 will be prioritized over 1, 2, 3, and 4 when
             "app:defaultFocusOverridesHistory" is true.
         (2) When it needs to initialize the focus (such as when a window is opened), it will
             search for a view in the window and focus on it. The view is chosen in the
             following order:
               1. the first "android:focusedByDefault" view, if any
               2. the first "app:defaultFocus" view, if any
               3. the selected item in a scrollable container, if any
               4. the first focusable item in a scrollable container, if any
               5. the first focusable view that is not a FocusParkingView, if any
         If there is only one FocusArea that needs to set default focus, you can use either
         "app:defaultFocus" or "android:focusedByDefault". If there are more than one, you
         should use "android:focusedByDefault" in the primary FocusArea, and use
         "app:defaultFocus" in other FocusAreas. -->
