This directory contains a reference implementation for sensors sub-HAL to be
used by sensors Multi-Hal 2.0 service for Android Automotive OS with Android
running as a VM. This HAL accesses sensors exposed as IIO devices by the kernel.

This HAL is currently only supported for use with the IIO SCMI driver in the kernel
which uses the ARM SCMI protocol to access the sensors exposed as VIRTIO SCMI device.

This HAL supports Accelerometer and Gyroscope continuous sensors.
